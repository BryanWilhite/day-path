# Day Path: my 11ty-driven technical Blog ✒

The Blog articles fall into this repo from my, um👀, [Blog](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/Blog) repository. This repo is not really about the writing of the articles. It is more about the [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/)💄 pipeline, [MDC Web](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web) and the indexing🔍 of the articles (🚧with `@songhay/index` [[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@songhay/index)]).
