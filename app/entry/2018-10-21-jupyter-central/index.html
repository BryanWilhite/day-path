    <h1>jupyter central</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Algorithm-Design-Manual-Steven-Skiena/dp/1848000693?SubscriptionId=1SW6D7X6ZXXR92KVX0G2&amp;tag=thekintespacec00&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=2025&amp;creative=165953&amp;creativeASIN=1848000693"><img alt="The Algorithm Design Manual" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/515GcxK1FFL.jpg" style="float:right;margin:16px;"></a></p>
<p>I am sure there are many reasons why <code>Span&lt;T&gt;</code> (and <code>Memory&lt;T&gt;</code>) was <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Connect/2017/T125">introduced</a> to the .NET Framework. To me, these C# language features are a response to the dangerous (and tedious) supremacy of handling data in unmanaged memory in general and the ease of handling gigantic chunks of in-memory data in Python in particular.</p>
<p>My interest in Python goes back to <a href="https://www.blender.org/features/scripting/">my attraction to Blender 3D</a> but the active use of Python really got going for me with my discovery of <a href="http://jupyter.org/try">jupyter notebooks</a>. In the same flippant manner that I regard <code>Span&lt;T&gt;</code> (and <code>Memory&lt;T&gt;</code>) as response to what has been in enjoyed in Python (inter-operating with unmanaged libraries) for years, jupyter notebooks are an open-source response to commercial <a href="http://www.wolfram.com/technologies/nb/">Mathematica notebooks</a>.</p>
<h2>jupyter notebooks online</h2>
<p>The complications around sharing Mathematica notebooks online are now laughable to me as I use <a href="https://notebooks.azure.com/rasx">Azure notebooks</a> and <a href="https://mybinder.org/">binder</a> which I can point at <a href="https://github.com/BryanWilhite/jupyter-central">my jupyter central repo</a>.</p>
<p>Mathematica <em>will</em> reign supreme in many, many applications from its <em>three decades</em> of development but Mathematica by design has <em>one</em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rewriting">term-rewriting</a> language for its kernel while jupyter notebooks can support <a href="https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels">several kernels</a> in addition to the traditional/historical python. There is even a kernel for <a href="https://github.com/mmatera/iwolfram">the Wolfram language</a>! Moreover, jupyter notebooks can be supported by Docker containers via <a href="https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">JupyterHub</a>, spinning up custom environments for, say, <a href="https://medium.com/@ybarraud/setting-up-jupyterhub-with-sudospawner-and-anaconda-844628c0dbee">anaconda</a>.</p>
<h2>Coursera algorithms jupyter notebooks</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-4th-Robert-Sedgewick/dp/032157351X?SubscriptionId=1SW6D7X6ZXXR92KVX0G2&amp;tag=thekintespacec00&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=2025&amp;creative=165953&amp;creativeASIN=032157351X"><img alt="Algorithms (4th Edition)" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41%2BpJNrGujL.jpg" style="float:left;margin:16px;"></a></p>
<p>I decided to take on the Princeton course, <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1/">Algorithms, Part I</a>, based on my ignorant assumption that I could participate through the use of jupyter notebooks. I discovered quickly that the course <em>requires</em> the use of Java. I then responded with <em>more</em> ignorance, thinking that I can use <a href="https://github.com/SpencerPark/IJava">a jupyter Java kernel</a>.</p>
<p>As of this writing, Microsoft’s Azure notebooks offers only an F# kernel as an alternative to Python. This means that I might find a repo with a YAML file showing me how to setup a Java-kernel jupyter environment for <a href="https://mybinder.org/">binder</a>. But the binder experience is still in beta and quite temporal.</p>
<p>To not use jupyter notebooks for this study means I would have to work exclusively on Ubuntu virtual machines where I can tolerate Java installations. I cannot bring myself to dump upwards of 600MB of Java environment on a Windows machine just to “play” with it. Pathetically, I dropped out of the Princeton course.</p>
<p>The Princeton course is a wonderful product of the Robert Sedgewick ‘camp’ which is responsibly Java based, coming with all the formal time constraints of actively participating in a college course. I have found the <em>algorist</em> camp, the online world setup by Steven S. Skiena (<a href="http://algorist.com/">algorist.com</a>), more freeform, language-agnostic and casual.</p>
<p>And it must be said that there is a Udemy course in Python by Holczer Balazs, his <a href="https://www.udemy.com/algorithms-and-data-structures-in-python/">Algorithms and Data Structures in Python</a>. There is also a Pluralsight course, <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/graph-algorithms-python?aid=7010a000001x3JXAAY&amp;promo=&amp;oid=&amp;utm_source=non_branded&amp;utm_medium=digital_paid_search_bing&amp;utm_campaign=Bing_US_Dynamic&amp;utm_content=&amp;s_kwcid=AL!5668!10!77446913240513!dat-2329246664020045:loc-190&amp;ef_id=WbqObwAABGZYzA5z:20181021084406:s">Working with Graph Algorithms in Python</a>, by Googler <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jananiravi">Janani Ravi</a>. But these Python-friendly courses are not free of charge.</p>
<h2>learning data visualization and algorithms with jupyter notebooks</h2>
<p>When I quit the Sedgewick course, I was very interested in visualizing <a href="https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/assignments/percolation.html"><em>percolation</em></a> in a jupyter notebook. There are <a href="https://github.com/topics/monte-carlo-simulation?l=jupyter+notebook">a couple of repos on GitHub</a> that look promising. Stumbling into examples of additional visualizations, I have this jumble so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>“<a href="http://chuckpr.github.io/blog/trees2.html">Making trees in the Jupyter notebook</a>”</li>
<li>“<a href="https://plot.ly/python/tree-plots/">Python Tree-plots</a>”</li>
<li>“<a href="https://medium.com/@rnbrown/creating-and-visualizing-decision-trees-with-python-f8e8fa394176">Creating and Visualizing Decision Trees with Python</a>”</li>
<li>“<a href="http://etetoolkit.org/docs/2.3/tutorial/tutorial_drawing.html">The Programmable Tree Drawing Engine—A Python Environment for (phylogenetic) Tree Exploration</a>”</li>
<li>“<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23429117/saving-nltk-drawn-parse-tree-to-image-file/24748479#24748479">Saving nltk drawn parse tree to image file</a>”</li>
<li>“<a href="https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/windowsapps/Drawing-Binary-Search-Trees-4c49410f">Windows 8 Drawing Binary Search Trees sample in C# for Visual Studio 2008</a>” [to emphasize my apparent lack of focus]</li>
</ul>
<h2>going forward</h2>
<p>When I quit the Sedgewick course, I left <a href="https://notebooks.azure.com/rasx/libraries/coursera-algorithms-part-1">a jupyter notebook of my notes</a> and sense of accomplishment. So far, I am regarding my study of <a href="https://github.com/BryanWilhite/LinqPad/blob/e472f15f572f35a4557f47c769e684eddccd8d4a/Queries/funkyKB/Interview%20-%20powered%20by%20HackerRank%20-%20consecutive%20sums.linq">the backtracking algorithm in C# via LINQpad</a> as my only accomplishment in this area.</p>
<p>It <em>feels</em> like I am planning to continue my read of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Algorithm-Design-Manual-Steven-Skiena/dp/1848000693?SubscriptionId=1SW6D7X6ZXXR92KVX0G2&amp;tag=thekintespacec00&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=2025&amp;creative=165953&amp;creativeASIN=1848000693"><em>The Algorithm Design Manual</em></a> (which was interrupted by following a disinterested third-party into the Sedgewick camp). Staying focused on the Skiena camp as an introduction and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFjhkohHdAA&amp;list=PLOtl7M3yp-DV69F32zdK7YJcNXpTunF2b">watching his lecture videos</a> without time constraints might be the way to go. I can do the other stuff later which, sadly, might be <em>years</em> later.</p>
<p>The Skiena read is punctuated by exercises that <em>will</em> lead me back to jupyter notebooks. It should help to regard this Blog entry as my survey of the lay of the land, allowing me to withdraw and focus on <em>my</em> comfort zone of self-study. There is no pleasing of others.</p>
