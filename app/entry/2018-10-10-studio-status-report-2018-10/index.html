    <h1>studio status report: 2018-10</h1>
<h2>the new SonghaySystem.com released</h2>
<p><a href="http://SonghaySystem.com">SonghaySystem.com</a> is released. <a href="https://twitter.com/BryanWilhite/status/1049413752955629568">I tweeted about it</a> to capture the moment—which was a moment of exhaustion. I would love to say that this release captured all of the Angular-related topics I plan to study but I can’t. These major questions remain:</p>
<ul>
<li>is it possible to set up an Angular module as a local (folder-based) NPM module?</li>
<li>do Angular 6.x projects replace or compete with nrwl workspaces?</li>
<li>will my Angular builds actually need Apollo and GraphQL (on ASP.NET Core) or will converting my Promises patterns to <code>async</code>-<code>await</code> patterns do just fine?</li>
</ul>
<h2>the job market and comp-sci theories</h2>
<p>I have been looking for a new .NET job for <em>at least</em> two years. The previous sentence implies a lot of things so <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/wilhite/">check me out on LinkedIn</a> to get timings right: I resigned from my previous post two weeks before my final day, 8/31/2018.</p>
<p>Continually, I am asked the question, “What are you looking for in your next position?” Here is my answer in descending order of importance:</p>
<ul>
<li>the organization actively invests in Microsoft: no Ballmer-era products like ASP.NET Web Forms that treat .NET 4.0 (and Visual Studio 2013) as “new” technology</li>
<li>the organization uses automated testing in Visual Studio solutions under source control</li>
<li>the organization has <em>some</em> kind of agile practice</li>
</ul>
<p>These requirements of mine are the bare minimum, quite impoverished actually. I must confess that I have not worked with a team meeting these requirements. On the flip side, the requirements placed on <em>me</em> as a candidate often involve computer-science-based questions. <a href="http://songhayblog.azurewebsites.net/blog/entry/the-three-things-i-have-done-about-failing-in-job-interviews">I have complained about this</a> previously but over the last month I have come to a constructive, more refined understanding.</p>
<p>The social-media phenomenon has caused many fashion trends; one leading trend in my job market is an alleged interest in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory#Computer_science">graph theory</a>. I am authentically interested in programmatic graph traversal for my long-time interest in data visualization. Underneath (or next to) graph theory is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorics#Graph_theory"><em>combinatorics</em></a> (also, see “<a href="https://trycatch.me/combinatorics-in-net-part-i-permutations-combinations-variations/">Combinatorics in .NET</a>”) which is a word I’ve been throwing around for decades in relation to factorials and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation">permutation</a><em>not</em> graphs (and <em>not</em> for algorithms using <a href="https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/80223/using-backtracking-to-find-all-possible-permutations-in-a-string">backtracking</a>). So it is time for me to get graphical as well as numerical. My work with TypeScript, by the way, piques my interest in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory">set theory</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_theory">type theory</a>—so all of these theories need to be dragged into my studio and made coherent with current study and priorities.</p>
<p>Another interview-related technical subject is multi-threading. It was my error to regard multi-threading as an edge-case of .NET leading down into C++ (this is my WPF-influenced point of view). It is better for my career path to view multi-threading in the context of the history of ASP.NET. These articles help:</p>
<ul>
<li>“<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23912456/asp-net-multithreading-web-requests">ASP.NET Multithreading Web Requests</a>”</li>
<li>“<a href="https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1067678/Practical-multithreading-in-ASP-NET">Practical multithreading in ASP.NET</a>”</li>
<li>“<a href="https://www.hanselman.com/blog/TheMagicOfUsingAsynchronousMethodsInASPNET45PlusAnImportantGotcha.aspx">The Magic of using Asynchronous Methods in ASP.NET 4.5 plus an important gotcha</a>”</li>
<li>“<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/web-forms/overview/performance-and-caching/using-asynchronous-methods-in-aspnet-45">Using Asynchronous Methods in ASP.NET 4.5</a>”</li>
</ul>
<p>The most important point here is that the subject of multi-threading in ASP.NET is supposed to lead to the subject of <code>async</code>-<code>await</code> patterns in ASP.NET MVC. Ballmer-era ASP.NET multithreading uses Web Forms stuff like <code>Page_Load</code> with <code>RegisterAsyncTask(new PageAsyncTask(MyDelegateSignatureAsync))</code> (replaced by <code>HttpTaskAsyncHandler</code> in .NET &gt;=4.5; also, .NET 4.5.2 introduced <code>HostingEnvironment.QueueBackgroundWorkItem</code> [<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.web.hosting.hostingenvironment.queuebackgroundworkitem?view=netframework-4.7">docs</a>] for fire-and-forget scenarios which is less risky than the use of <code>async</code>-<code>void</code>).</p>
<p>It must be said that the subject of “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices">micro-services</a>” should lead to the topic of multi-threading in ASP.NET. This is because one call for client data might require several <code>async</code> calls to multiple “micro” services. As of this writing, I have not encountered this scenario because I am using Azure web jobs to assemble one, static JSON file from several service calls.</p>
<p>And, for healthy interview prep, it is always useful to read, “<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/garbage-collection/fundamentals">Fundamentals of Garbage Collection</a>,” at least once every six months. (Garbage collection algorithms depend on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure)">the heap data structure</a> which is a specialized tree structure, leading back to Graph Theory via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm">Dijkstra’s algorithm</a>.)</p>
