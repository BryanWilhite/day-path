    <h1>The Ornery Twitter API 1.1: Struggling with the Lack of Fresh Documentation</h1>
<p>The abstract “personality” of Twitter matches the curt, blunt tone coming from the current “leader” of Twitter, CEO Dick Costolo in “<a href="https://bit.ly/2M70BPX">Twitter’s CEO says a leader doesn’t care what people think and shouldn’t copy others</a>” (by Ken Yeung). It took me a ridiculously large time to solve my problem with the Twitter API (version 1.1) because of Twitter culture not caring what I think (especially as a .NET developer).</p>
<p>I am not alone. Collectively, Twitter doesn’t care what Tom Scott of the <a href="http://www.tomscott.com/klouchebag/">“dead” KloucheBag</a> thinks either:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They’re steadily squeezing out third-party clients like Tweetbot, Echofon and Dabr, and they’re removing unauthenticated API calls. The latter means that every Twitter app, no matter how minor, will require a “Sign in with Twitter” button.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What Tom is saying here is not exactly true: what he might say after a little Twitter-soul searching is every Twitter app <em>that matters</em> will require a Twitter button. You see folks my app does not matter because it is built for me, alone. I am a registered developer with Twitter. I have registered my application with Twitter—and for my troubles I was given keys and secrets that I can send to Twitter and pretty much do what I want <em>as long as I am working with my own Twitter account</em>.</p>
<p>So: for a .NET developer like me who make apps that don’t matter I recommend installing the NuGet Package <code>LinqToTwitter</code> and then doing a little something like this (in ASP.NET MVC space):</p>
<pre><code class="language-c#">[HttpPost]
public ActionResult TwitterItems()
{
    var authorizer = this.GetLinqToTwitterCredentialsAndAuthorizer();
    var ctx = new TwitterContext(authorizer);
    var query = ctx.Favorites
        .Where(i =&gt; i.Type == FavoritesType.Favorites)
        .Where(i =&gt; i.Count == 50)
        .Where(i =&gt; i.IncludeEntities == true);
    var count = query.Count();
    if (count == 0) throw new TwitterQueryException(&quot;No items were found.&quot;);
    var favorites = query.ToList();
    if (favorites == null) throw new TwitterQueryException(&quot;No items were found.&quot;);
    return this.Json(favorites);
}
</code></pre>
<p>I make it look so easy after all of my unknowns are known. But I can assure you it was a ridiculously comical nightmare to get to this level of simplicity—and it is all for an app that does not really matter (because it is designed for one Twitter account—<em>my</em> account).</p>
<h2>Twitter Documentation ‘Misleading’</h2>
<p>The Twitter REST API documentation should introduce itself to newbies by prioritizing “<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/auth">Authentication &amp; Authorization</a>.” The opinion here is that it is ‘misleading’ to visually position this subject below or next to other REST API subjects. It should be made clear that, in the 1.1 API world, you can do <em>nothing</em> unless you get authentication and authorization working. The academic subtlety of a statement like “Be sure and read about <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/auth">Authentication &amp; Authorization</a>” does not suggest that it is a prerequisite instead of an optional detail.</p>
<p>Once a Twitter application is defined I suggest starting with cURL by selecting the OAuth Tool for the application and press the <strong>See OAuth signature for this request</strong> button. Greg Williams details this in “<a href="http://greglib.org/using-twitters-oauth-tool/">Using Twitter’s OAuth Tool</a>.” From my Ubuntu command line, we have verification that Twitter is working with your account:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">curl --get 'https://api.twitter.com/1.1/favorites/list.json' --data 'count=2&amp;screen_name=BryanWilhite' --header 'Authorization: OAuth oauth_consumer_key=&quot;[your key]&quot;, oauth_nonce=&quot;[nonce]&quot;, oauth_signature=&quot;[signature]&quot;, oauth_signature_method=&quot;HMAC-SHA1&quot;, oauth_timestamp=&quot;1373088858&quot;, oauth_token=&quot;[token]&quot;, oauth_version=&quot;1.0&quot;' –verbose
</code></pre>
<p>This cURL statement is altered from the one provided by Twitter as it is retrieving just two of my Favorites from my account with get operation, <code>--get 'https://api.twitter.com/1.1/favorites/list.json'</code>, with data parameter, <code>--data 'count=2&amp;screen_name=BryanWilhite'</code>. The rest of the cURL statement comes from Twitter.</p>
<p>This cURL command represents a request for a Twitter app that ‘does not matter’—it represents what Twitter calls an “<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/auth/application-only-auth">application-only auth</a>” request opposed to an “<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/auth/obtaining-access-tokens">OAuth signed</a>” request. But this classification feels ‘misleading’ to me because both requests use OAuth—right? No?</p>
<h2>“Authorizers” in LinqToTwitter</h2>
<p>Most of the ‘comical’ misery with Twitter comes in generating the Authorization header. You can literally see this by measuring how much our cURL command above is dominated by authorization data. In the world of <code>LinqToTwitter</code>, the ‘seed’ that generates the header is the <em>authorizer</em>.</p>
<p>It took me months to find that the authorizer for my limited needs is the <code>SingleUserAuthorizer</code> (which should be called—according to Twitter documentation—“application-only-authorizer”?) From my ASP.NET MVC example above we have:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c#">ITwitterAuthorizer GetLinqToTwitterCredentialsAndAuthorizer()
{
    var data = new OpenAuthorizationData(ConfigurationManager.AppSettings);
    var authorizer = new SingleUserAuthorizer
    {
        Credentials = new InMemoryCredentials
        {
            ConsumerKey = data.ConsumerKey,
            ConsumerSecret = data.ConsumerSecret,
            OAuthToken = data.Token,
            AccessToken = data.TokenSecret
        },
    };
    return authorizer;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>OpenAuthorizationData</code> instance is of a little housekeeping class I use to clearly define my keys and secrets.</p>

For a very large time I assumed that I could get things to working solely with `DotNetOpenAuth`. Nope. By the way, there is no official answer to this StackOverflow.com question. Also: it was this question that really helped me to distinguish between *authentication* and *authorization*: “The `DotNetOpenAuth.AspNet.Clients.TwitterClient` class only allows authentication, not authorization. So you wouldn't be able to post tweets as that user if you use that class. Instead, you can use `DotNetOpenAuth.ApplicationBlock.TwitterConsumer` [[http://nuget.org/packages/DotNetOpenAuth.ApplicationBlock](http://nuget.org/packages/DotNetOpenAuth.ApplicationBlock)], which does not share this limitation and you can even copy the source code for this type into your application and extend it as necessary.”
